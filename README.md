## About The Project

Liva Studio is a photography website created for one of my clients. I am still waiting for photos, so currently a placeholder images are displayed.

## Demo

Here is a working [live demo ](https://liva-studio.netlify.app/) on temporaty domain.

## How I worked on this project

I have used Next.js, Tailwind and a few libraries (like React Slider) for this project. 

#### Performance

My goal was to achieve the best possible performance, especially on a mobile. Every image has been optimised using a great tool called Squoosh, available online [link](https://squoosh.app/) and saved in webP format, which is a standard nowadays. Images are lazy loaded and some components dynamically imported.

I am still trying to remove unused Js by analyzing every chunk. In order to achieve that, I installed webpack bundle analyzer.

#### Accessibility

I am still working to improve accessibility. I have recently changed heading order.

To do :
- improve focus in portfolio and about pages
- lock focus in modal

#### SEO

to be done
